The dataset comprises detailed records of network activities, capturing various attributes of network connections. Each record is labeled as either normal or a "Neptune" attack, enabling binomial classification.

A Neptune attack, also known as a SYN flood attack, is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker overwhelms a target system with excessive SYN requests. This disrupts the TCP handshake process, consuming system resources and making it unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

The training dataset consists of 86,845 records, each indicating whether the activity (column: Attack) is normal or an attack. This data was used to train a machine learning model, which was then applied to predict the status of 21,712 test entries, determining whether each represents normal activity or a Neptune attack.
